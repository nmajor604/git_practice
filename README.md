# git_practice
This is a simple practice file that I created to finally get the hang of all things git. 
I'm going to use this file to practice all the common git commands and features. 

I'm also using it to get a better grasp of some of the commonly used features of github.

This practice was based on the W3Schools Git tutorial, and focuses mainly on synching your local and remote repos, push/pull and merging branches.
